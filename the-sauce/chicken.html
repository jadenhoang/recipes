    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>This delicous chicken can be made right now! It only takes 30 minutes, prepared to be amazed.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/3 cup white wine or chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 (14 1/2 ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 (5.2-ounce) package soft cheese, such as BoursinÂ® Garlic & Fine Herbs Gournay cheese, cut into cubes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>4 cups packed roughly-chopped fresh spinach</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh chives</li>

    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice chicken breasts across the grain of the meat into cutlets, or have the butcher do it for you. Season both sides of each cutlet with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat oil and butter in a large skillet over medium heat. When the butter is melted, swirl the pan to mix butter and oil.</li>
        <li>Lightly brown seasoned chicken cutlets, turning once, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and keep warm.</li>
        <li>To the same skillet, add onion and cook about 2 minutes. Increase heat to medium high. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add wine and cook, stirring, until most of the liquid is evaporated, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low.</li>
        <li>Stir in tomatoes and juice, Boursin, and Italian seasoning. Continue stirring occasionally, until the cheese is melted, about 5 minutes. Stir in chopped spinach.</li>
        <li>Return chicken and any accumulated juices to the skillet, coating each side with the sauce. Allow to heat in the skillet until an instant-read thermometer inserted near the center of chicken reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh minced chives.</li>
    </ol>
