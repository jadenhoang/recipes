                <li>Take the ice cream out of the freezer and let it sit on counter for about 30 minutes (until softened.)</li>
                <li>Crush and measure out your corn flakes.<br> <img src="https://www.thecountrycook.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_7131-1-683x1024.jpg" alt = "CrushedFlakes" height = "400" width="300" </li>

                <li>Add sugar and cinnamon to crushed corn flakes and stir or shake it up in the ziploc bag until thoroughly coated.</li>
                <li>In a large skillet, melt butter over medium-low heat.</li>
                <li>Once melted add the corn flake mixture. Stir constantly for about 4-5 minutes until lightly golden brown. Do not walk away and do not turn up the heat. You don’t want the sugar to burn. Take off heat and allow to cool.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine softened vanilla ice cream, whipped topping and vanilla extract. Use a large spoon and stir until combined well.</li>
                <li>Spread half of the cornflake mixture into the bottom of a 9×13 baking dish. Just press down with your hand until it is evenly spread out.</li>
                <li>Then pour ice cream mixture over corn flake mixture. Spread out evenly.</li>
                <li>Finally, top with remaining corn flake mixture.</li>
                <li>Cover and pop into freezer for at least 3-4 hours to let it all set up.</li>
                <li>When ready to serve, cut into squares and serve with a drizzle of honey or chocolate and caramel sauces! <br> <img src="https://www.thecountrycook.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Fried-Ice-Cream-Cake-forkful.jpg" width = "400" height="300" alt=Baked Icecream</li>
